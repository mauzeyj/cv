<p><em>Data Scientist specializing in creating web apps backed by AI that automate cognitive tasks, that get better with
    use vs. development hours.</em></p>
<p>Currently working at Clearwater Analytics building AI backed tools to reduce the labor of each associated task by an
    estimated 80%.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Collect data from multiple sql databases and endpoints and present for user to make decision. Train variety of
    models to create a human in the loop system where the individual only has to confirm the models decision. This
    project is interesting because it is a proof of concept for creating a suite of machine learning backed that are
        limited in scope and the number of people that do the tasks. This will identify how "small" these apps can be
    and set the stage for how quickly they can be created.</li>
